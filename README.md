# mini_py_projects
Welcome to my collection of Python Mini Projects 🐤 As a junior Python developer, I've embarked on a journey to enhance my coding skills. These mini projects are a reflection of my learning process and dedication to mastering Python. 
I'm passionate about continuous improvement, and I'm actively seeking opportunities to expand this project portfolio. Feel free to explore these mini projects 🧋
